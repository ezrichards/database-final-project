## Database Final Project

This is our CSCI403 Database Final Project where we analyzed NBA player salaries vs. player statistics.

Some of our queries are done in `other_queries.sql`, our webscraper/cleaner is in `webscrape.py`, and our main data loading and manipulation is done in `project.sql`. Our multiple regression model was done in R, in the file `finalMLR.rmd`.

All datasets are in their corresponding .csv files. Our slides and report can be found in their corresponding .pdf files.
